# Common Errors 🛠️
The toggle button or the sidebar doesn’t appear?
Sometimes GitHub pages load dynamically and the extension may not initialize properly right away.

👉 Quick fix: Simply refresh the page. This usually resolves the issue and the sidebar will appear as expected.

If the problem persists, make sure:

- You're on a public GitHub repository.
- The extension is enabled in your browser.
- You're using a compatible browser (Chrome or Brave).
